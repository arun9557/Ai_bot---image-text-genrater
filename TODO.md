# TODO - Image Generation Improvements

## Frontend Timeout Handling

### Current State
- ✅ 60-second timeout implemented for image generation
- ✅ Basic error handling for network timeouts
- ✅ Loading state with spinner animation

### Planned Improvements

#### 1. Extended Timeout Support
- ✅ Increase timeout from 60 seconds to 120 seconds for complex image generation
- [ ] Add configurable timeout based on image complexity
- [ ] Implement progressive timeout warnings

#### 2. Enhanced Progress Feedback
- ✅ Add progress bar with estimated time remaining
- ✅ Show generation stages (initializing, processing, finalizing)
- ✅ Display helpful tips during long generation times
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed generations

#### 3. Better Error Handling
- ✅ Distinguish between different types of errors (timeout, server error, network error)
- ✅ Provide specific error messages and recovery suggestions
- [ ] Add automatic retry for transient errors
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries

#### 4. User Experience Improvements
- ✅ Add "Cancel Generation" button for long-running requests
- [ ] Show generation queue status if multiple requests
- [ ] Add generation history with thumbnails
- [ ] Implement offline queue for failed generations

#### 5. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement request deduplication
- [ ] Add image caching for repeated prompts
- [ ] Optimize image loading and display
- [ ] Add image compression options

## Backend Improvements

### Current State
- ✅ Pollinations API integration
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Image download and serving

### Planned Improvements

#### 1. Enhanced API Integration
- [ ] Add support for multiple image generation APIs
- [ ] Implement API fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Add image generation queue management
- [ ] Support for different image models and styles

#### 2. Better Error Handling
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Add detailed error logging
- [ ] Implement retry logic for API failures
- [ ] Add rate limiting and quota management

#### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Add image caching layer
- [ ] Implement async image processing
- [ ] Add image optimization and compression
- [ ] Implement CDN integration for faster delivery

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Basic image generation with Pollinations API
- ✅ Frontend timeout handling (120 seconds)
- ✅ Loading states and error messages
- ✅ Image download functionality
- ✅ Enhanced progress feedback with stages and progress bar
- ✅ Better error handling with specific error messages
- ✅ Cancel generation functionality
- ✅ User-friendly tips and guidance
- ✅ Backend timeout increased to 120 seconds
